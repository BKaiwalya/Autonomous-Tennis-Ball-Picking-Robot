“An Autonomous Tennis Ball Picking Robot”   
 Project sponsored by Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG 
 Development of an autonomous robot for picking tennis balls on a lawn tennis field. 
 Detection of tennis balls by image processing through Machine Learning (Haar Cascading, CNN). 
 Traversal of the robot towards the co-ordinate of ball by closed loop locomotion through gyroscope & rotary encoders. 
 The microcontroller used is ARM Cortex M4 (STM32 Nucleo-64 F446RE). 
 Wireless data transmission to the robot via communication protocols Zigbee and Bluetooth v2.0. 
 Sensors: Camera, gyroscope, proximity, rotary encoders  Software development in C, Python 3
